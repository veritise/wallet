* Altered UI elements (colors, text, icons) for a more appealing, consistent and coherent appearance.
* Changed some terminology:
	* Mosaics       -> Tokens
	* Harvesting    -> Staking
* Veritise-paper-wallets node module has been added to enhance the design of exported PDF paper wallet (when making a backup of accounts or mnemonic phrases).

### Known issues

* The process of starting Delegated Staking may be problematic, as there may be difficulties in linking the node, remote and vrf keys. Linking a key may appear to be ineffective, as the screen may not refresh after signing the linking transaction. In that case, logout and login again.

***
### Additional notes

* The RSS feed (cryptonews.com) is fetched using a CORS proxy (cors-bridged) if the project is deployed in the 'development' environment, and without a proxy if the project is in the 'production' environment. For the web version of the project, the news section normally may not show any fetched news due to CORS policy, thus the CORS proxy is applied.

# Troubleshooting & FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
### Q: Nothing happens after I press "Link All keys" in the Staking menu and sign the transaction. What do I do?
 A: Try logging out of your account, and login again. Alternatively, link each key manually.

### Q: Nothing happens once I link a node, remote or vrf key in the Staking menu. What do I do?
 A: The linking may take up to 30 seconds, and the screen should refresh afterwards. If that doesn't happen, try logging out of the account and logging in again.

### Q: The Staking status is stuck on "ACTIVATION IN PROGRESS". What do I do?
 A: Check if you have more than 200 of network currency and staking currency, and if your Importance is higher than 0. Otherwise, stop the staking process, relink all the keys and try starting the staking process again. If all else fails, try a different node.

### Q: There's an issue that's not documented in this section. What do I do?
 A: If you encounter an issue, please click the "See an issue?" button in the bottom right corner and fill in the details of the issue report.
